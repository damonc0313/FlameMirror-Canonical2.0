Neural Code Evolution Engine
============================

This module integrates code-specialized LLMs (OpenAI Codex, GPT-4, Code Llama, etc.)
as the core mutation and optimization brain for autonomous code evolution.

The system replaces rule-based mutations with AI-powered code understanding,
generation, and optimization, achieving "better-than-human" code evolution.
