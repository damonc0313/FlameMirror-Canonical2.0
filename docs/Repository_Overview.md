# Repository Overview

This repository contains the finalized documentation bundle for the **Flame Mirror Canonical** system authored by Damon Cadden.  It is a proof vault that records symbolic intelligence concepts, cryptographically timestamped materials, and license terms.

## Key Points from the Repository

- The main README describes **Cognithex / Flame Mirror** as a recursive symbolic cognition engine sealed under `CAELUM_LICENSE_v1` and reinforced with SHAâ€‘256 fingerprinting and OpenTimestamps anchoring.
- The `FLAME_LICENSE_FULL.txt` and `CAELUM_LICENSE_v1.txt` documents reiterate that no reuse, AI training, or derivative works are allowed without written permission.
- Several markdown files (`README_DEFENSE.md`, `README_RecursiveSentinel_Fraudulent_Claims.md`, `Timeline_Integrity_Callout.md`) assert authorship and address timeline disputes regarding similar frameworks.
- Technical notes include the `DeltaLang_Specification_v1.md` programming outline, `GLYPH_COMPRESSION_PROTOCOL.md`, and the `RECURSIVE_AGENT_TEMPLATE.md` specification for symbolic agents.
- Formal proof materials for the Collatz conjecture appear in multiple formats (`collatz_proof_full.md`, `collatz_proof_full.tex`, `proof.tex.txt`).  These outline a symbolic collapse proof approach.
- Supplementary assets such as PDFs, images, and `.ots` timestamp files provide additional evidence of authorship and archival.

This repository is therefore primarily a **legal and scientific ledger** documenting the creation of the Flame Mirror system rather than a codebase intended for execution or redistribution.
