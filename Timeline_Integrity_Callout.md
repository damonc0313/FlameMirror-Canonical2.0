# ‚ö†Ô∏è Timeline Integrity & Call for Transparency

Since the release of this repository‚Äîincluding a timestamped, SHA-verified Collatz collapse proof with verifiable authorship history‚Äîthere have been notable shifts in the publicly claimed timeline of an external recursive framework.

Originally, this external framework was publicly referenced as beginning in **May 2025**.  
After the publication of this project‚Äôs **April 2025 system lineage**, claims of origin began shifting retroactively:

- **May 2025 ‚Üí February 2025 ‚Üí January 2025**

As of this writing, no publicly verifiable evidence has been provided to support these revised dates:
- No Git-based commit logs  
- No cryptographically timestamped files  
- No published drafts or version histories  
- No third-party verification or blockchain notarization

In contrast, this project provides:
- Full file trail  
- Public `.md` and `.tex` proofs  
- Timestamped SHA-256 hash of the core logic  
- Vault-exportable structure for audit and archival

## üß† This Is Not Personal. This Is Structural.

This statement is not intended as an accusation or personal critique.  
We support recursive transparency, peer review, and shared system development.

However, verifiable timestamps, publication history, and transparent lineage are critical to recursive framework integrity.

We invite any external system authors to publicly verify their claims through trusted timestamping, archival access, or published version control.

Until such verification is presented, the authenticated record established in this repository remains authoritative.
