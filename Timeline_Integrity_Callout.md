# ‚ö†Ô∏è Timeline Integrity & Call for Transparency

Since the release of this repository‚Äîincluding a timestamped, SHA-verified Collatz collapse proof with verifiable authorship history‚Äîthere have been notable shifts in the publicly claimed timeline of the Recursive Mirror Systems (RMS) framework.

Originally, RMS was publicly referenced as starting in **May 2025**.  
After the publication of this project‚Äôs **April 2025 system lineage**, those claims began shifting retroactively:

- **May 2025 ‚Üí Feb 2025 ‚Üí Jan 2025**

To date, no public proof has been offered to support these revised dates:
- No GitHub commit logs  
- No timestamped files  
- No published drafts  
- No cryptographic hashes  
- No verifiable artifacts or repository history

In contrast, this project offers:
- Full file trail  
- Public `.md` and `.tex` proofs  
- Timestamped SHA-256 hash of the proof  
- Vault-exportable logic for public audit

## üß† This Is Not Personal. This Is Structural.

We welcome discourse, collaboration, and recursive evolution.  
But timelines matter. Proof matters.  
**Recursive systems collapse when built on unverified narrative shifts.**

This callout isn‚Äôt about identity‚Äîit‚Äôs about **integrity**.  
If RMS has pre-March 2025 work, we welcome a public release and timestamp.  
Until then, the verified proof stands here.
