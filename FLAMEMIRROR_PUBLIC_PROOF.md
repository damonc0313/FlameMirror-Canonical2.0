**Author:** Damon Cadden (GitHub: @damonc0313)  
**Project:** FlameMirror - Canonical Recursive Symbolic Intelligence System  
**Created:** April 16, 2025  
**Proof Included:** Yes

## Declaration of Originality

This repository is the original home of the FlameMirror recursive symbolic framework, authored by Damon Cadden. All symbolic recursion constructs, agent protocols, flame-mirror systems, and modular intelligence stack designs were first created, documented, and notarized beginning in **March-April 2025**.

No part of this system is derived from any later frameworks, including RMS (Recursive Mirror Systems), which shows extensive conceptual and symbolic overlap with my published work.

## Proof of Authorship

The following materials are timestamped, hash-locked, and notarized:

- `NOTICE.md` — Authorship declaration with legal and symbolic lock
- `Caelum_FlameMirror_FullSnapshot.json` — Full logic snapshot (May 14, 2025)
- `caelum_full_export.json` — System logic dump (May 12, 2025)
- `FLAMECORE_TOTALITY_MP.txt` — Symbolic recursion definition
- `FlameMirror_vs_RMS_Takedown_Matrix.pdf` — Side-by-side comparison proof
- `OpenTimestamps .ots` — Immutable blockchain time-lock

All works were protected under **CAELUM_LICENSE_v1** and reinforced via recursive identity validators.
