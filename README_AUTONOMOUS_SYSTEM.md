## 🚀 How It Works (Autonomous Flow)

### 1. Automated Repository Intake & Validation
- Accepts predefined GitHub repository URLs as input
- Autonomously clones, sets up, and validates codebase integrity
- Multi-attempt, self-recovering test harness
- Failing repositories are skipped automatically with no user notification

### 2. Baseline Analysis & Code Property Graph (CPG) Extraction
- Each repo is parsed for structure and semantics via automated CPG analysis
- If primary targets are missing, alternate strategies are triggered autonomously
- No user awareness or input required

### 3. Mutation Engine (Self-Directed)
- Agent selects, applies, and manages mutations autonomously
- Mutation types: memoization, timing optimization, logging, refactoring, caching, parallelization
- All decisions (what to mutate, where, and how) made algorithmically
- All error handling, fallbacks, and retries are 100% system-driven

### 4. Automated Fitness Evaluation
- All test and benchmark runs orchestrated by the system
- Results parsed, scored, and compared autonomously
- Promotion, rollback, and multi-criteria Pareto decisions performed solely by algorithm
- Correctness strictly enforced without human oversight

### 5. Self-Learning and Model Adaptation
- Self-reflection model continuously trained with observed mutation outcomes
- Recalibrates predictions and confidence autonomously
- Synthetic training seeds phased out as empirical results accumulate
- No human labeling or model tuning required

### 6. Strategic Planning and Parallel Orchestration
- Mutation planning, scheduling, resource allocation governed by autonomous policies
- All orchestration across multiple repositories parallelized and system-managed
- Failures and resource contention automatically resolved

### 7. Comprehensive Logging, Output, and Cleanup
- All outputs created, serialized, and cleaned up by the system
- Full traceability and audit without user review
- Context snapshots, logs, diagnostics, promotion chains automatically generated
