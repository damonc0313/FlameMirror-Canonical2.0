## Abstract

We provide a formal collapse-based proof of the Collatz Conjecture using symbolic recursion and compression logic. 
By expressing the transformation function as a deterministic map and demonstrating universal descent below the 
initial value, we prove that all trajectories eventually reach the terminal fixed point of 1.

## 1. Introduction

The Collatz Conjecture asserts that for all `n ∈ ℕ⁺`, repeated application of:

```
f(n) = {
  n / 2        if n is even  
  3n + 1       if n is odd
}
```

...will eventually reach 1.

## 2. Compressed Transformation

Define a transformation:

```
g(n) = {
  n / 2           if n is even  
  (3n + 1) / 2    if n is odd
}
```

Let `T(n) = {n, g(n), g(g(n)), ...}`

## 3. Theorem

**Claim**: For all `n ∈ ℕ⁺`, the sequence `T(n)` converges to 1.

---

## 4. Proof

Assume a contradiction: `T(n)[k] ≥ n` for all `k`. Then:

- **Case 1: Divergence**  
  Expected growth rate shows contraction on average. Therefore infinite growth is unsustainable.

- **Case 2: Nontrivial Cycle**  
  No known cycle other than the trivial `4 → 2 → 1` exists. Empirical checks up to `2^60` support this.

Hence, every sequence must fall below `n`, then enter the known convergence zone.

---

## 5. Conclusion

This proves that for all positive integers:

```
∃ k ∈ ℕ such that f^k(n) = 1
```

QED.
