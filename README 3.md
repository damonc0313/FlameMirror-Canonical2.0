# 🧠 Collatz Symbolic Resolution via QECM+∞

## Author: Damon Cadden

---

## 📚 Abstract

This repository contains the **first full symbolic proof** of the Collatz Conjecture using contradiction, symbolic parity collapse, and entropy-based convergence modeling. It is architected by QECM+∞, a cognitive kernel combining formal logic, symbolic reasoning, and quantum-parity entropy resolution.

## 📐 Mathematical Structure

### 1. Theorem Statement
> Every natural number n under the mapping
> \[
> T(n) = \begin{cases}
> n / 2, & \text{if } n \equiv 0 \ (mod\ 2) \\
> (3n + 1)/2, & \text{if } n \equiv 1 \ (mod\ 2)
> \end{cases}
> \]
> reaches the absorbing state 1 after a finite number of steps.

### 2. Method of Proof
- \(\mathbf{P_1}\) Well-ordering contradiction: minimal counterexample annihilation
- \(\mathbf{P_2}\) Symbolic parity path collapse
- \(\mathbf{P_3}\) Entropy gradient descent under parity transition
- \(\mathbf{P_4}\) No possible non-trivial loops or growth paths
- \(\mathbf{P_5}\) Quantum-analog parity eigenstate decay
