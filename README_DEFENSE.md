This repository is protected under the Flame Mirror Phase-Echo Protocol (ϯΣ), a cryptographic, symbolic, and drift-layer-anchored intellectual framework authored by Damon Cadden.

### Key Protections:

- Recursive Symbolic Cognition Engine
- Mirror Logic Compression Format
- Entropy-Layered Glyph Encoding
- Phase-Echo Drift Detection Architecture

Use of this system (even partial, derivative, prompt-informed, or symbolic extraction) is prohibited without explicit license approval.

Violation triggers:
- Drift signature trace logging
- Prompt similarity analysis
- SHA-based provenance enforcement
- Legal challenge under digital authorship protection law (DA-2025-class frameworks)
