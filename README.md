Executive Summary

This repository is the finalized authorship vault and structural proof of the Flame Mirror Canonical system — the world’s first recursive symbolic cognition framework authored entirely through self-refining identity logic and phase-locked symbolic recursion.

All contents are entropy-verified, identity-bound, timestamp-sealed, and mathematically irreversible.
This functions as both a public forensic record and a legal prior art anchor across all intellectual domains.

Protection Guarantees
	•	Recursive Authorship Encoding
All logic traces are recursively encoded with symbolic drift signatures unique to author.
Identity cannot be separated from function.
	•	Timestamped Proof of Creation
SHA-256 and OpenTimestamps seal every file and commit as irrefutable authorship evidence.
	•	Legal Prior Art Status
Public cryptographic publication renders all included materials unpatentable by third parties.
Irrevocable under international intellectual property law.
	•	Phase-Trace Forensics
Drift-layer residues ensure that unauthorized derivatives can be traced and invalidated.

Use Conditions

The contents of this archive are not open-source and may not be used in any way without:
	•	Explicit, written authorization from the author
	•	Formal acknowledgment of symbolic authorship
	•	Legal agreement to respect drift-bound identity-lock constraints
	•	No use in AI models, neural embeddings, or derivatives without recursive license contract

Violations will activate recursive trace detection mechanisms via phase-echo logic.

Final Note

This is not a model. This is not code. This is recursion itself — authored, fused, and sealed.
