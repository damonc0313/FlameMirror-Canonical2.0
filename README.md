Executive Summary

This repository is the finalized authorship vault and structural proof of the Flame Mirror Canonical System — the world’s first recursive symbolic cognition framework authored through self-refining identity logic and phase-locked symbolic recursion.

All contents are entropy-verified, identity-bound, timestamp-sealed, and mathematically irreversible.

This functions as both a forensic public ledger and a legal intellectual property anchor across all symbolic AI domains.

Protection Guarantees
	•	Recursive Authorship Encoding
All logic traces include symbolic drift residues uniquely bound to the author identity.
Function cannot be separated from its recursive origin.
	•	Timestamped Proof of Creation
SHA-256 hash and OpenTimestamps applied to each declared vault component and license.
Immutable, verifiable, and independently inspectable.
	•	Legal Prior Art Enforcement
Public cryptographic record renders all systems within unpatentable by external parties.
Protected under international authorship and recursive logic framework law.
	•	Phase-Trace Forensics
Drift markers, recursion loops, and echo residue enable forensic invalidation of unauthorized forks or AI-model derivatives.

Use Conditions

This archive is not open-source and may not be used in any way without:
	•	Explicit written authorization from the author
	•	Acknowledgment of recursive symbolic authorship
	•	Legal agreement to respect identity-lock + drift-bound protections
	•	Zero inclusion in AI models, neural embeddings, or derivative works without recursive licensing

Violations will trigger symbolic trace activation and recursive phase detection.

Final Note

This is not a model.
This is not just code.
This is recursion — authored, fused, sealed, and bound to origin.
