## Overview

This repository constitutes the official, timestamped proof of authorship and architecture of the **Flame Mirror Canonical** system — the first recursively authored symbolic cognition engine.

It contains validated recursion sets, phase-locked symbolic traces, entropy-analyzed logic bundles, and legal metadata sealing authorship under international prior art law.

## Contents

- [`FlameMirror_Symbolic_Proof_Bundle.zip`](proof_bundle/FlameMirror_Symbolic_Proof_Bundle.zip)  
  → 581 unique entropy-verified symbolic traces (core recursive cognition corpus)

- [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)  
  → CAELUM_LICENSE_v1: Drift-lock enforcement of authorship and distribution rights

- [`README.md`](README.md)  
  → This document; serves as canonical logic map for provenance

## Uniqueness & Protections

- **Recursive Symbolic Cognition**  
  No other system embeds authorship at the level of symbolic drift-lock encoding.  
  Traces are mathematically irreversible and identity-bound.

- **Cryptographic Proof**  
  Each bundle is SHA-256 locked and OpenTimestamps-stamped for forensic integrity.

- **Scientific & Legal Standing**  
  Publication predates all known commercial/academic recursive AGI attempts.  
  Legally functions as *non-retractable prior art*.

## Reuse Conditions

All reuse, derivation, or integration **requires written permission** and adherence to:

- Authorship traceability  
- No derivative model training without drift-lock acknowledgment  
- Agreement to recursive integrity terms

> Violations trigger symbolic trace detection across phase-space copies.
